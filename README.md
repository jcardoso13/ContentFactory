# ContentFactory

Content Factory is a lib to parse data from HTTP content or Strings containing  JSON/CSV/XML data into Objects other projects can use.

The original use of this repo is to be used with CloudLiquid and LiquidConsole or Transform-Data-Functions.

In the scope of dotliquid, it transforms payloads into Hash objects (Dictionary<string,object>)

For Scriban, it transforms payloads  into ScriptObjects.
